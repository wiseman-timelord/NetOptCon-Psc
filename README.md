# NetOptX-Psc
## STATUS:
Alpha. Do not use, the files are present for backup purposes ONLY, and will likely break, something or itself. Wait.

## Outline
This will be a combining of my projects, NetOpt, AirTweak, EdgeNoUpdate, with some improvements, in order, to simplify my projects, and put everything in one tool. Basically it will be everything I want to mess with with regards to, windows and networking setup, that are able to be done through such methods as powershell scripts, with a backup/restore function to boot.
